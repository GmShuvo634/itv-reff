## 🔧 **Issues Found & Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Missing Referral Hierarchy Building**
- **Problem**: Referral hierarchy was not being built automatically during user registration
- **Location**: `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- **Fix**: Added call to `EnhancedReferralService.buildReferralHierarchy()` after successful referral processing
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

```typescript
// Build referral hierarchy for the new user
try {
  await EnhancedReferralService.buildReferralHierarchy(user.id);
  console.log(`✅ Referral hierarchy built for user: ${user.email}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`❌ Failed to build referral hierarchy for user ${user.email}:`, error);
  // Don't fail registration if hierarchy building fails
}
```

## 🎯 **Key Features Verified**

### **Referral Hierarchy**
